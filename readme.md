### Report

##### Completeness 
the home page is completely filled with personal information sorted by containers. Containers in columns for no particular reason other than aesthetic.

The about page is divided into four sections, the same as in this file, because I wanted to make a fixed navigation bar at the bottom.

Chat page in progress.
